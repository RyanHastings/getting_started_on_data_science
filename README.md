# COVID-19 modeling

The first week I started as a data analyst at the Indiana State Department of Health, the coronavirus pandemic reached us.
There was an immediate need for modeling, and with my background in meteorology, I was perfect for it.  I quickly learned the
basics of epidemiological modeling and slapped together a simple but effective model.  This was the ISDH SEIR model, part of
the critical ensemble of models used by the state.  We eventually discontinued it in favor of other models.  [This version](COVID19) is
a simplified version for show purposes.
