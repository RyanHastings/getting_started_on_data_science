# [COVID-19 modeling](COVID19)

The first week I started as a data analyst at the Indiana State Department of Health, the coronavirus pandemic reached us.
There was an immediate need for modeling, and with my background in meteorology, I was perfect for it.  I quickly learned the
basics of epidemiological modeling and slapped together a simple but effective model.  This was the ISDH SEIR model, part of
the critical ensemble of models used by the state.  We eventually discontinued it in favor of other models.  [This version](COVID19) is
a simplified version for show purposes.

# [Predicting Infant Mortality](Categorization_Problem/cat_problem.html)

While working at the Indiana Department of Health, one of my major tasks was analyzing infant mortality data for the Maternal
and Child Health division.  I basically did some descriptive statistics on the data set, then did a logistic regression to try and
predict whether a child with characteristics listed on the birth certificate would die within one year of being born.  They never
wanted me to go further with predictive algorithms, but I've decided to play around anyway.  This section is in progress, with
updated coming every week, but simulates a population with "infant death" and attempts to apply classification and predictive
models.
