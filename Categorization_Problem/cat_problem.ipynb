    "# Infant Mortality\n",

    "One of my primary tasks at the Indiana Department of Health was, given the data from a child's birth certificate, determine the probability of their death.  After linking the birth and death certificates, this involved simply giving a report of the descriptive statitistics of infant deaths (defined as deaths of children who were born who died one year or younger) followed by a logistic regression.  I was never asked to make a more detailed predictive model, but as this is a project for my portfolio and not for my job, we can have a little fun.  Below I will first do a logistic regression, and then try a decision tree, a neural network, and a random forest.  *Note to readers:  This is a work in progress.  So far I've only done the logistic regressionnext step is a decision tree.  This page will be updated weekly.*\n",
